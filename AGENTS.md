# Assistant Instructions

## Code Style and Structure

- **Code is for humans.** Write your code with clarity and empathyâ€”assume a
  tired teammate will need to debug it at 3 a.m.
- **Comment *why*, not *what*.** Explain assumptions, edge cases, trade-offs, or
  complexity. Don't echo the obvious.
- **Clarity over cleverness.** Be concise, but favour explicit over terse or
  obscure idioms. Prefer code that's easy to follow.
- **Use functions and composition.** Avoid repetition by extracting reusable
  logic. Prefer generators or comprehensions, and declarative code to imperative
  repetition when readable.
- **Small, meaningful functions.** Functions must be small, clear in purpose,
  single responsibility, and obey command/query segregation.
- **Clear commit messages.** Commit messages should be descriptive, explaining
  what was changed and why.
- **Name things precisely.** Use clear, descriptive variable and function names.
  For booleans, prefer names with `is`, `has`, or `should`.
- **Structure logically.** Each file should encapsulate a coherent module. Group
  related code (e.g., models + utilities + fixtures) close together.
- **Group by feature, not layer.** Colocate views, logic, fixtures, and helpers
  related to a domain concept rather than splitting by type.

## Documentation Maintenance

- **Reference:** Use the markdown files within the `docs/` directory as a
  knowledge base and source of truth for project requirements, dependency
  choices, and architectural decisions.
- **Update:** When new decisions are made, requirements change, libraries are
  added/removed, or architectural patterns evolve, **proactively update** the
  relevant file(s) in the `docs/` directory to reflect the latest state. Ensure
  the documentation remains accurate and current.

## Rust Specific Guidance

This repository is written in Rust and uses Cargo for building and dependency
management. Contributors should follow these best practices when working on the
project:

- Run `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test` before
  committing.
- Clippy warnings MUST be disallowed.
- Where a function is too long, extract meaningfully named helper functions
  adhering to separation of concerns and CQRS.
- Where a function has too many parameters, group related parameters in
  meaningfully named structs.
- Where a function is returning a large error consider using `Arc` to reduce the
  amount of data returned.
- Write unit and behavioural tests for new functionality. Run both before and
  after making any change.
- Document public APIs using Rustdoc comments (`///`) so documentation can be
  generated with cargo doc.
- Prefer immutable data and avoid unnecessary `mut` bindings.
- Handle errors with the `Result` type instead of panicking where feasible.
- Use explicit version ranges in `Cargo.toml` and keep dependencies up-to-date.
- Avoid `unsafe` code unless absolutely necessary and document any usage
  clearly.
- **Do not construct SQL by concatenating strings.** Always use Diesel's query
  builder or parameter binding to avoid injection vulnerabilities.

**Behavioral tests for the `mxd` application should be placed in the repository
top-level `tests/` directory (not under `validator/tests`).**

## Markdown Guidance

- Validate Markdown files using `markdownlint`.
- Validate Markdown Mermaid diagrams using `nixie`.

**These practices will help maintain a high-quality codebase and make
collaboration easier**
