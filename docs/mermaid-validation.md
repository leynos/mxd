# Mermaid Diagram Validation

Mermaid diagrams are rendered client-side, so a small syntax error can leave a
broken image in the documentation. To prevent this, every Markdown document that
includes a `mermaid` code block must be checked before merging.

## Requirements

- Install the [`nixie` CLI](https://github.com/leynos/nixie) and ensure it is
  available on your `PATH`.

## Running the validator

From the repository root run `nixie` with one or more Markdown paths:

```bash
nixie docs/chat-schema.md docs/news-schema.md
```

You can pass directories and the validator will search for Markdown files
recursively. Shell expansion lets you validate everything in `docs/` at once:

```bash
nixie docs/*.md
```

For machines with many cores, increasing the concurrency can speed up
validation. By default the script uses the number of CPU cores detected on your
system. Use the `--concurrency` flag to override the number of diagrams rendered
in parallel:

```bash
nixie --concurrency 8 docs/*.md
```

The script extracts each `mermaid` block, attempts rendering with an embedded
Mermaid renderer, exits with a non-zero status on syntax errors, and prints the
failing diagram's line with an error pointer.

If `nixie` is not found on your `PATH` the validator explains how to install it.

Include this step in your workflow whenever you edit Markdown documentation
containing Mermaid diagrams.
